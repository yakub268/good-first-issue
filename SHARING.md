**Post**:
```
I got frustrated trying to find my first open source contribution. Most "good first issue"
finders just dump random issues, half are vague or in dead projects.

So I built a tool that:
- Analyzes YOUR GitHub profile (starred repos, languages)
- Scores issues on 4 factors: clarity, maintainer response, freshness, project health
- Shows only quality matches with beautiful terminal output

It's free, open source, and takes 30 seconds to try:

pip install git+https://github.com/yakub268/good-first-issue
gfi init --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
gfi find

GitHub: https://github.com/yakub268/good-first-issue

Feedback welcome! The project itself has good first issues if you want to contribute.
