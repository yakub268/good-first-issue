I need help deploying my Flask web app to Render.com. Guide me through the process step-by-step.

## What I'm Deploying

A Flask web application called "Good First Issue Finder" that helps developers find quality open source issues to contribute to.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/yakub268/good-first-issue

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.11
- Flask 3.0+
- httpx, pydantic, python-dotenv
- Gunicorn (WSGI server)

## Project Structure

```
good-first-issue/
├── web/
│   ├── app.py              # Main Flask application
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── index.html      # Frontend UI
│   ├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
│   ├── Procfile           # Process file (gunicorn app:app)
│   └── runtime.txt        # Python version (3.11.0)
├── gfi/                    # Python package (imported by app.py)
│   ├── github.py
│   ├── analyzer.py
│   ├── scorer.py
│   └── ...
└── render.yaml            # Render config
```

## Configuration Details

**Root Directory:** `web` (the app is in the web/ subdirectory)

**Build Command:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start Command:**
```
gunicorn app:app
```

**Environment Variable Required:**
- Key: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Value: I have a GitHub personal access token (starts with ghp_)
- This is required for the app to work - it calls the GitHub API

**Port:** Render auto-assigns (Flask defaults to 5000 but Gunicorn will use Render's PORT env var)

## What I Need Help With

1. Walk me through the Render.com dashboard to deploy this
2. Help me configure the service correctly
3. Make sure the root directory and build commands are set right
4. Add the environment variable securely
5. Troubleshoot any build/deployment errors
6. Verify the app is working after deployment

## Current Status

- Code is pushed to GitHub (master branch)
- I'm logged into Render.com in my browser
- I have a GitHub token ready to add
- This is my first time using Render

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

When I visit the deployed URL:
- Should see a clean landing page with a search box
- Enter a GitHub username → shows matching issues
- Should work in ~5 seconds
- Mobile-friendly

## Questions to Ask Me

- What do you see on your Render dashboard?
- Have you connected your GitHub account to Render?
- Do you see any errors in the build logs?
- What URL did Render assign to your app?

Walk me through this step-by-step and help me troubleshoot any issues. I'm ready to start.
